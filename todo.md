ToDo for completion of TeamProfileGenerator:

Create test.js files for manager, engineer and intern etc.

Maybe create those first, as per test driven development.

Then create the parent class Employee

Then create the sub classes of manager engineer and intern.

Then fill in index.js file which requires all the js files alongside, FS and Jest for tests

create inquirer.prompt function and add messages and names etc.

have a generate html function using template literals that populates the index.html with the data answered from the prompts. [Use "If you see any bugs, please <a href="mailto:webmaster@somedomain.com">
    contact webmaster</a>.<br>" as an example for the inputting of email adresses]

    and for the github usernames, <a> tag with a target blank href so that it opens in a new tab.
